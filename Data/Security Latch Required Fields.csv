Component Type,Required Fields (ALL),Optional Fields (ANY),Notes
LED,Forward Voltage (Vf) Volts | Resistance Between Power Ohms,,
Servo,Operation_Volts | Operation_Amps_At_Volts,,
Resistor,Resistor Resistance Ohms,,
ESP32-CAM,Operation_Volts | Operation_Amps_At_Volts | Idle Power,,
4 Batteries,Operation_Volts | Operation_Amps_At_Volts,,If circuit uses 3W and this has 5W there's 2W of surplus left over (dependent on sunlight). Watts here is subtractive. There's no idle power as other circuit electronics may use idle power from this but it does not apply directly to this item.
