Component Type,Required Fields (ALL),Optional Fields (ANY),Notes
Flip-Flop,Resistance Between Power Ohms | Maximum Input Voltage Volts | Safe Limits Range in Amps,Connected to Transistor Component Name,
LED,Forward Voltage (Vf) Volts | Resistance Between Power Ohms,,
Servo,Operation_Volts | Operation_Amps_At_Volts,,
Transistor,Base-Emitter Voltage Drop V_BE Volts,,
Arduino Uno R3,Idle Power,,
Resistor,Resistor Resistance Ohms,,
ESP32-CAM,Operation_Volts | Operation_Amps_At_Volts | Idle Power,,
Solar Panel Source,Operation_Volts | Operation_Amps_At_Volts,,If circuit uses 3W and this has 5W there's 2W of surplus left over (dependent on sunlight). Watts here is subtractive. There's no idle power as other circuit electronics may use idle power from this but it does not apply directly to this item.
Solar Panel Manager,Operation_Volts | Operation_Amps_At_Volts | Max Charge Current,,This doesn't add or subtract anything just use this as a check to go with the solar panel
PIR Motion Sensors,Operation_Volts | Operation_Amps_At_Volts,,
Battery Holder,Number Of Batteries,,
Cooling Fan,Operation_Volts | Operation_Amps_At_Volts,,
